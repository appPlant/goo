    -p    			        Pretty print output as a table
    -l    			        Load bash profiles on Server
    -t    			        Show type of planet
    -h    			        Display this help text
    -v    			        Show version number
    -d			            Show extended debug informations


## Prerequisites
Create an enviroment variable called `ORBIT_HOME` and set it to the absolute path of the ski folder-structure. 

Example: You save the release at `/home/youruser/workspace/ski`. Your `ORBIT_HOME` should be `/home/youruser/workspace/ski`as well

Either create an enviroment variable called `ORBIT_KEY` containing an absolute path to the ssh private key that should be used for executing commands on the planets or save said key at `ski/config/ssh/`.

You'll need the following installed and in your `PATH`:
- [fifa][ff]

## Installation

Download the latest version from the [release page][releases] and add the executable to your `PATH`.

## Development

Clone the repo:
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/appPlant/goo.git && cd goo/

And then execute:

```bash
$ scripts/compile # https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation
```

You'll be able to find the binaries in the following directories:

- Linux (64-bit, for old distros): `build/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-glibc-2.12/bin/ski`
- Linux (32-bit, for old distros): `build/i686-pc-linux-gnu-glibc-2.12/bin/ski`
- Linux (64-bit GNU): `build/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-glibc-2.14/bin/ski`
- Linux (32-bit GNU): `build/i686-pc-linux-gnu-glibc-2.14/bin/ski`
- Linux (64-bit BusyBox): `build/x86_64-pc-linux-busybox-musl/bin/ski`
- OS X (64-bit): `build/x86_64-apple-darwin14/bin/ski`
- OS X (32-bit): `build/i386-apple-darwin14/bin/ski`
- Windows (64-bit): `build/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/ski`
- Windows (32-bit): `build/i686-w64-mingw32/bin/ski`

## Basic Usage

Get the connection by type:

    $ export ORBIT_FILE=/path/to/orbit.json

    $ ski -c="hostname" app-package-1 app-package-2
    $ hostname-1
    $ hostname-2

## Advanced features

Execute a script:

    $ ski -s="scripts/hostname.sh" app-package-1 app-package-2
    $ hostname-1
    $ hostname-2

Pretty print output:

    $ ski -p -c="hostname" app-package-1 app-package-2
    
      NR   PLANET          hostname
      ===============================
       0   app-package-1   hostname-1
       1   app-package-2   hostname-1

## Releases

    $ scripts/release

Affer this command finishes, you'll see the /releases for each target in the releases directory.

## Tests

To run all integration tests:

    $ scripts/bintest
